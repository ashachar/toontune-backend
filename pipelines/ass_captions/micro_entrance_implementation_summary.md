# Micro-Entrance Animation Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Words in Path 2 (phrases with word timings but whole-phrase effects) were appearing abruptly at their timestamps without any animation. Each word would suddenly pop in at 100% opacity.

## Solution Implemented
Added **micro-entrance animations** for individual words in Path 2:

### Key Features
1. **Per-word fade-in**: Each word fades in over 200ms when its timestamp arrives
2. **Per-word micro-slide**: Words slide in slightly (20px) from the same direction as the phrase effect
3. **Layout stability**: Word positions are pre-calculated to avoid text jumping
4. **Combined animations**: Micro-entrance works alongside phrase-level animations

### Technical Implementation

#### Micro-Entrance Calculation
```python
# Calculate per-word micro-entrance progress
word_time_elapsed = current_time - word_start
word_progress = min(1.0, word_time_elapsed / word_fade_duration)

# Apply easing to the word's entrance
word_eased = 1 - pow(1 - word_progress, 3)  # Ease-out cubic

# Calculate word opacity (combines micro-entrance with phrase opacity)
word_opacity = word_eased * base_opacity
```

#### Micro-Slide Effect
```python
# Apply per-word micro-slide (only during micro-entrance)
if word_progress < 1.0:
    micro_slide_factor = 1.0 - word_eased
    micro_x_offset = int(word_slide_distance * micro_dir_x * micro_slide_factor)
    micro_y_offset = int(word_slide_distance * micro_dir_y * micro_slide_factor)
    word_x += micro_x_offset
    word_y += micro_y_offset
```

#### Direction Mapping
The micro-slide direction matches the phrase's entrance effect:
- `fade_slide_from_top` → Words slide from top (micro_dir_y = -1)
- `fade_slide_from_bottom` → Words slide from bottom (micro_dir_y = 1)
- `fade_slide_from_left` → Words slide from left (micro_dir_x = -1)
- `fade_slide_from_right` → Words slide from right (micro_dir_x = 1)

### Parameters
- **word_fade_duration**: 0.2 seconds (200ms)
- **word_slide_distance**: 20 pixels (smaller than phrase slide)
- **Easing function**: Ease-out cubic for smooth deceleration

## Results
✅ Individual words now fade in smoothly when their timestamps arrive
✅ Words have subtle slide animations matching the phrase direction
✅ No more abrupt appearances or disappearing/reappearing issues
✅ Layout remains stable (no text jumping)
✅ Phrase-level animations still work correctly

## Test Verification
The implementation was verified with:
- "AI created new math" using `fade_slide_bottom` effect
- "AI invented a new calculator" using `fade_slide_top` effect
- Debug logs confirm Path 2 is being used and micro-entrance is triggering
