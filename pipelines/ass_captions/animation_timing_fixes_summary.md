# Animation Timing Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Entrance Animations Not Visible
**Problem**: Text appeared abruptly at their start timestamps without any animation.

**Root Cause**: The visibility gate only allowed rendering AFTER `phrase["start_time"]`, preventing the entrance animation from playing before the logical start time.

**Solution**: Implemented "draw_start" concept:
- `draw_start = logical_start - entrance_duration` (0.4s before)
- Text starts rendering at 0% opacity before its logical start
- Reaches 100% opacity AT the logical start time
- Smooth entrance animations now visible

### 2. Disappearance Animations Not Working
**Problem**: Text disappeared abruptly at scene end times without animation.

**Root Cause**: The same end time was used for both visibility gating and animation triggering, creating an impossible condition.

**Solution**: Implemented "draw_end" concept:
- `draw_end = logical_end + disappear_duration` (0.5s after)
- Text continues rendering past its logical end
- Fades from 100% to 0% opacity during disappearance phase
- All phrases in a scene share the same disappearance effect

## Implementation Details

### Key Timing Windows
```python
# Timing definitions
logical_start = phrase["start_time"]
logical_end = scene_end_time or phrase["end_time"]
entrance_duration = 0.4  # 400ms
disappear_duration = 0.5  # 500ms

# Extended draw windows for animations
draw_start = logical_start - entrance_duration
draw_end = logical_end + disappear_duration
```

### Animation Phases
1. **ENTRANCE** (t < logical_start):
   - Progress: 0% → 100%
   - Opacity: 0 → 1
   - Position: Slide effects active

2. **STEADY** (logical_start ≤ t < logical_end):
   - Full opacity
   - Final position
   - No animation

3. **DISAPPEAR** (t ≥ logical_end):
   - Progress: 0% → 100%
   - Opacity: 1 → 0
   - Position: Slide out effects active

### Files Modified
- `sam2_head_aware_sandwich.py`: Main implementation file
  - Updated `render_phrase()` method with new timing logic
  - Fixed main loop phrase collection to use extended windows
  - Updated head-tracking phrases to use same timing
  - Added debug logging for animation phases

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_entrance_animations.py`: Verifies entrance animations work
- `test_disappearance.py`: Verifies disappearance animations work
- `entrance_animation_fix.md`: Technical documentation of the fix

## Results
✅ Entrance animations now play smoothly before logical start times
✅ Disappearance animations fade/slide out after logical end times
✅ Head-tracking phrases ("Yes,") animate properly with their scenes
✅ All phrases in a scene share consistent disappearance effects
✅ Text behind head stays behind during all animation phases

## Timeline Example
For a phrase "Hello World" starting at t=1.0s, ending at t=2.0s:

```
Time:     0.6s    1.0s    2.0s    2.5s
          |       |       |       |
Entrance: [=====>]
Steady:           [=======]
Disappear:                [=====>]
Opacity:  0%→100% 100%    100%→0%
```

The animations now provide smooth, professional transitions that enhance the viewing experience.
