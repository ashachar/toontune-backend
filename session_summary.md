# Session Summary: Word Dissolve Animation Fixes

## Video Being Worked On
- **Test video**: `test_element_3sec.mp4` (1166x534 @ 60fps)
- **Text being animated**: "HELLO WORLD"
- **Animation pipeline**: TextBehindSegment → WordDissolve

## Animation Sequence
The complete animation has 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Shrink (Foreground)
- Text starts large and shrinks while in front of subject
- **FIX APPLIED**: Text now stays fully opaque during shrink (no premature fading)

### Phase 2: Transition (Moving Behind)
- Text moves from foreground to background
- **FIX APPLIED**: Text fades from 100% → 50% opacity with exponential curve (slow start, fast end)

### Phase 3: Stable Behind
- Text sits behind subject at 50% opacity
- Mask recalculation for pixel-perfect occlusion

### Phase 4: Word Dissolve
- Letters dissolve upward one by one
- **FIX APPLIED**: Random dissolve order instead of left-to-right
- **FIX APPLIED**: Each letter only disappears when its specific dissolve starts

## Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. Letter Reappearance Bug
**Problem**: Letters were returning after dissolving
**Solution**: Implemented persistent "kill mask" that permanently removes dissolved pixels

### 2. Rectangular Artifacts
**Problem**: Gray rectangular frames around dissolving letters
**Solution**: 
- Skip space character sprites
- Remove disconnected pixels using connected components
- Apply Gaussian feathering with larger radius (11px)

### 3. Per-Letter Timing
**Problem**: All letters disappeared when first letter started dissolving
**Solution**: Each letter now only disappears from base text when its individual dissolve animation begins

### 4. Ghost Letters
**Problem**: Faint letter traces remained at original positions during dissolve
**Solution**: Aggressive masking with binary thresholding to completely remove letters from base

### 5. Alpha Transition Timing
**Problem**: Text was fading during shrink phase while still in foreground
**Solution**: Text now only starts fading when it actually passes behind subject (phase 2)

### 6. Transparency Curve
**Problem**: Linear fade looked unnatural
**Solution**: Exponential curve (k=3.0) - very slow fade at start, rapid at end

### 7. Dissolve Order
**Problem**: Predictable left-to-right dissolve was boring
**Solution**: Letters now dissolve in random order for visual interest

### 8. Dynamic Masking
**Problem**: Static mask didn't track moving subjects
**Solution**: Mask can be recalculated every frame during occlusion phases

## Technical Details
- All videos encoded in H.264 format with yuv420p pixel format for compatibility
- Using rembg (u2net) for subject segmentation
- Premultiplied alpha compositing to avoid RGBA fringing
- Debug logging with [DISSOLVE_BUG] prefix for tracking issues

## Current State
The animation system now properly handles:
- Smooth text transition from foreground to background
- Pixel-perfect occlusion behind moving subjects
- Natural-looking dissolve effects with no artifacts
- Proper timing for each animation phase

## Output Files Created
- `hello_world_fade_after_behind.mp4` - Final test with all fixes applied
- Various fix scripts that modified the core animation classes
- Test scripts demonstrating each improvement
