    We have successfully pre-computed a Voronoi time map for an eraser wipe video effect using OpenCV, but FFmpeg's geq filter is still too slow even when just performing simple threshold comparisons against this pre-computed map. We need a solution that can efficiently apply the pre-computed time map to create a progressive erasure effect in real-time or near-real-time performance. The core challenge is that even with all complex computation moved outside FFmpeg, the simple per-pixel evaluation in geq is still causing unacceptable performance.
  </task_instruction>

  <problem_context>
    <summary>
      We've implemented a hybrid solution where:
      1. OpenCV pre-computes a perfect Voronoi time map (each pixel knows when to disappear)
      2. FFmpeg loads this map and should simply threshold it against current time
      However, even this simple threshold operation using geq is extremely slow (30+ seconds for 1 second of HD video).
      The mathematical solution is correct, but FFmpeg's expression evaluator is the bottleneck.
    </summary>
    
    <what_works>
      - Voronoi computation using OpenCV's distanceTransformWithLabels (fast, accurate)
      - Time map generation (16-bit grayscale PNG with erasure times)
      - Color preservation using alphamerge approach
      - Path synchronization between eraser visual and mask
    </what_works>
    
    <what_fails>
      - FFmpeg's geq filter evaluating even simple expressions for every pixel
      - Processing time: ~30-40 seconds per second of 1280x720 video
      - The expression is just: 255*clip((progress - p(X,Y)/65535.0)/ease + 0.5, 0, 1)
      - Even accessing pre-computed values via p(X,Y) is slow at HD resolution
    </what_fails>
    
    <performance_requirements>
      - Must process 2-second HD video in under 30 seconds total
      - Ideally real-time or 2-3x real-time for production use
      - Must maintain 100% pixel coverage and correct timing
      - Must work on macOS without GPU compute (no CUDA/OpenCL in FFmpeg)

For 1280x720 @ 25fps video:
- OpenCV time map generation: < 1 second (excellent!)
- FFmpeg processing with simple geq threshold:
  * Per frame: 921,600 pixel evaluations of mask_expr
  * Expression: ~50 characters, but interpreted for each pixel
  * Observed speed: ~30-40 frames per second processed
  * For 2-second (50 frames) video: ~30-40 seconds total
  
The bottleneck is entirely in FFmpeg's geq filter, even with pre-computed data!

  <core_question>
    Given that we have successfully pre-computed the complex Voronoi time map,
    how can we efficiently apply this map in FFmpeg without using the slow geq filter?
    
    The operation is conceptually simple:
    - For each frame at time T
    - For each pixel at (x,y)
    - If time_map[x,y] <= T: make pixel transparent
    - Else: keep pixel opaque
    
    But geq makes even this simple comparison prohibitively slow at HD resolution.
    We need an alternative approach that can perform this thresholding efficiently.
  </core_question>

    <criterion_1>
      Must process HD video at reasonable speed (< 30 seconds for 2 seconds)
    </criterion_1>
    
    <criterion_2>

    </criterion_2>
    
    <criterion_3>

    </criterion_5>
  </ideal_solution_criteria>

  <request_for_assistance>
    We have the correct algorithm and pre-computed data, but FFmpeg's geq filter
    is too slow even for simple threshold operations. We need either:
    
    1. A faster way to apply per-pixel thresholds in FFmpeg without geq
    2. An alternative filter chain that achieves the same result
    3. A hybrid approach that minimizes FFmpeg's per-pixel processing
    4. A completely different strategy that maintains performance
    
    The solution must work with standard FFmpeg on macOS and achieve reasonable
    performance for production use. The time map computation is solved; we just
    need an efficient way to apply it.
