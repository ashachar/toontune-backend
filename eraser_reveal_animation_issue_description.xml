  <problem_statement>
    The eraser wipe animation has two critical issues:
    1. VIDEO FREEZE: After the 0.6-second eraser animation completes, the video freezes 
       (showing the last frame) while audio continues playing normally.
    2. UGLY REVEAL: The current reveal mechanism uses discrete rectangular patches that 
       appear at fixed intervals, creating a blocky, unnatural effect instead of a smooth 
       erasing motion that follows the eraser's path.

  <observed_behavior>
    <issue_1_freeze>
      <symptom>Video playback freezes at approximately 0.6 seconds (end of eraser animation)</symptom>
      <details>
        - Last frame remains visible
        - Audio continues playing normally
        - Duration of output video is correct but video stream stops updating
      </details>
      <likely_cause>
        The filter chain might be incomplete after the eraser animation ends.
        The 'enable' clause ends at wipe_start + wipe_duration + 0.02, after which
        there might be no valid video stream to display.
      </likely_cause>

    <issue_2_blocky_reveal>
      <symptom>Rectangular/circular patches appear at discrete positions</symptom>
      <details>
        - Only 8 reveal patches for entire animation
        - Each patch appears suddenly at fixed time intervals
        - Patches are static circles/rectangles, not following eraser motion
        - Creates a stuttering, blocky effect instead of smooth erasing
      </details>
      <current_approach>
        Pre-calculates 8 positions along ellipse and reveals patches at those positions
      </current_approach>
    </issue_2_blocky_reveal>
  </observed_behavior>

  <desired_behavior>
    <smooth_reveal>
      The reveal should follow the eraser's path continuously, creating a trail
      effect where the original video is revealed smoothly behind the moving eraser,
      similar to how a real eraser would work on a whiteboard.
    </smooth_reveal>
    <continuous_playback>
      After the eraser animation completes, the video should continue playing
      normally, showing either the fully revealed original video or maintaining
      the last state without freezing.
    </continuous_playback>
  </desired_behavior>

    <solution_1_mask_accumulation>
      <approach>Use an accumulating mask that grows over time</approach>
      <description>
        Instead of discrete patches, create a continuously growing mask that
        follows the eraser's path, accumulating the revealed areas over time.

      <description>
        Use blend filters with decay to create a trail behind the eraser
        that gradually reveals the underlying video.

    <solution_4_fix_freeze>

      <description>
        After the eraser animation ends, ensure the filter chain continues
        to output the fully revealed original video or final composite state.
      </description>
      <method>
        Remove the 'enable' time limit or add a final overlay that takes over
        after the animation completes.

      How can we create a smooth, continuous reveal effect that follows the

      Should we use an accumulating mask approach or a trail-based effect for
