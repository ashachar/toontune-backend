## 2. Download and Select Whisper Model

- At launch, the app prompts to download a **Whisper model** (Tiny, Base, Medium, Large, etc.).
  - Choose a model based on desired speed/accuracy. Large=highest quality; Tiny/Base=faster.

## 3. Basic Transcription Workflow

  - Drag and drop media files into the MacWhisper window, or use the “Open File” button.
  - Optionally, record directly from the Mac’s mic or record system audio from meetings/apps.
  - Press “Transcribe.” All transcription happens locally—no files leave the machine.
  - Output appears as editable, time-stamped text synchronized with audio playback.[web:20][web:26][web:28]
