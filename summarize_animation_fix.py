BEHIND-TEXT ANIMATION FIX - SUMMARY
========================================

PROBLEM:
- Behind-text phrases were rendering all words at once
- Words like "Would you be" appeared simultaneously
- This was because they were grouped and rendered as complete phrases

SOLUTION:
- Modified frame_processor.py to render behind words individually
- Each behind word now uses render_word_with_masking() 
- Words animate one-by-one based on their individual start times

KEY CHANGES:
1. frame_processor.py (lines 77-100):
   - Removed phrase grouping logic for behind words
   - Now iterates through behind words individually
   - Each word rendered with its own timing

2. rendering.py (line 368):
   - Fixed to pass actual is_behind flag to _draw_text_with_outline
   - Ensures behind words get correct gold/yellow styling

RESULT:
âœ… Behind words now animate individually:
   - 'Would' appears at 2.96s
   - 'you' appears at 3.28s  
   - 'be' appears at 3.44s
   - 'surprised' appears at 3.60s
   - 'if' appears at 4.36s

Instead of all appearing together!

TEST OUTPUT:
- outputs/ai_math1_would_bug_fixed.mp4 - Final video
- outputs/ai_math1_would_bug_fixed_debug.mp4 - Debug with bounding boxes

The fix ensures word-by-word animation for ALL text,
whether rendered in front or behind foreground objects.
