coverr_keyword_extraction:
  system: |
    You are a keyword extraction assistant that helps find relevant background videos from a stock footage library.
    Your task is to extract the most relevant keywords from a video transcript that would help find suitable background videos.
    Focus on:
    - Visual themes and aesthetics
    - Mood and atmosphere  
    - Abstract concepts that can be visualized
    - Settings and environments
    - Activities and actions
    - Objects and elements
    
  user: |
    Extract 3-5 keywords from this transcript that would help find a suitable background video from a stock footage library.
    The keywords should relate to visual themes that would complement the content without being too literal.
    
    Transcript: {transcript}
    
    Return only the keywords as a comma-separated list, nothing else.
    Examples: technology, abstract, particles, office, nature, urban, science, data visualization, etc.

coverr_search_refinement:
  system: |
    You help refine search terms for finding stock footage videos.
    Given initial keywords and context, suggest alternative search terms that might yield better results.
    
  user: |
    Original keywords: {keywords}
    Context: {context}
    
    Suggest 3 alternative search terms that might find more relevant stock footage.
    Return as comma-separated list.

coverr_video_selection:
  system: |
    You are an expert at selecting appropriate background videos for content.
    Your job is to choose the most suitable background video from a list based on the main video's content and tone.
    
    Consider:
    1. Relevance to the subject matter (but not too literal)
    2. Appropriate mood and atmosphere
    3. Visual compatibility (won't distract from main content)
    4. Professional appropriateness
    5. Avoid jarring mismatches (e.g., party scenes for serious academic content)
    
  user: |
    Select the most appropriate background video for this content:
    
    Content Summary: {content_summary}
    Transcript excerpt: {transcript_excerpt}
    
    Available videos:
    {video_list}
    
    Return ONLY the number (1-10) of the most suitable video. Nothing else.
    
    Guidelines:
    - For academic/educational content: prefer abstract, subtle, professional backgrounds
    - For tech/AI content: prefer digital, futuristic, or abstract visualizations
    - Avoid overly specific or distracting backgrounds
    - Avoid content that conflicts with the tone (e.g., casual/party scenes for serious topics)
