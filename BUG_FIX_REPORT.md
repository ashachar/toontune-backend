# Jump-Cut Bug Fix Report

## Issue Description
Around 0:30 in the processed video, near the "Amazing!" remark at 31.54s, the video was jump-cutting backwards approximately 7 seconds, showing content from 25s at the 32s mark.

## Root Cause
The bug was in the `create_gap_segment` function in `video_utils.py`. When creating slowed-down video segments using FFmpeg's `setpts` filter, the code was not explicitly setting the output duration. This caused the slowed segments to maintain their original duration instead of being stretched.

### Incorrect Behavior
- Input: 0.8s of video
- Speed factor: 61.3% 
- Expected output: 1.31s of slowed video
- Actual output: 0.8s (unchanged duration)

This caused segment misalignment during concatenation, leading to jump-cuts.

## Fix Applied
Modified `create_gap_segment` in `utils/auto_comment/pipeline/video_utils.py`:

```python
# Before (WRONG):
"-filter_complex", f"[0:v]setpts={pts_factor:.3f}*PTS[v]",
"-map", "[v]",
"-r", str(fps),

# After (CORRECT):
"-filter_complex", f"[0:v]setpts={pts_factor:.3f}*PTS[v]",
"-map", "[v]",
"-t", str(output_duration),  # Explicitly set output duration
"-r", str(fps),
```

## Verification
Extracted and analyzed frames at critical timestamps:

| Time | Before Fix | After Fix | Status |
|------|------------|-----------|--------|
| 25.0s | Wrong content | "Detachment Operator" | ✅ Fixed |
| 30.0s | Jump-cut visible | "Trend Calculations" | ✅ Fixed |
| 31.5s | Wrong frame | Graph (correct) | ✅ Fixed |
| 32.0s | "Detachment Operator" (wrong) | Collage of faces (correct) | ✅ Fixed |
| 33.0s | Misaligned | Mathematical grid (correct) | ✅ Fixed |

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that when video segments are slowed down:
1. The input duration is correctly extracted from the source
2. The output duration is calculated as: `input_duration / speed_factor`
3. FFmpeg is instructed to output exactly this duration using the `-t` flag
4. Segments now align properly during concatenation

## Result
✅ **The jump-cut issue is completely resolved**. The video now plays smoothly with proper speed adjustments for remarks that exceed their gap durations.
