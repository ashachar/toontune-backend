# THE REAL ISSUE AND FIX

## You were right - I overcomplicated it!

The **ACTUAL PROBLEM**: The karaoke step (`karaoke_precise.py`) is missing video codec specifications in its FFmpeg command.

### Current broken command (line 483-490):
```python
cmd = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-i", input_video,
    "-vf", f"ass={ass_path}",
    "-codec:a", "copy",     # Only audio codec!
    "-y",
    output_video
]
```

### The fix needed:
```python
cmd = [
    "ffmpeg",
    "-i", input_video,
    "-vf", f"ass={ass_path}",
    "-codec:a", "copy",
    "-codec:v", "libx264",   # ADD THIS
    "-crf", "18",            # ADD THIS  
    "-y",
    output_video
]
```

## Why this causes the issue:

1. Without `-codec:v libx264`, FFmpeg uses default encoding which may not preserve overlays properly
2. The karaoke DOES work - it generates the subtitle file successfully
3. But the FFmpeg command fails silently or produces corrupted output
4. So the subsequent steps (phrases, cartoons) appear to work but are building on a broken base

## The Simple Fix:

Just add the video codec to the karaoke generation in `utils/captions/karaoke_precise.py` line 483-490.

That's it! No need for all my complex rewrites. The existing karaoke implementation is fine, it just needs the video codec specification.
