You are analyzing a video frame to determine where to place a text overlay.

Frame dimensions: 256x114 pixels
Text overlay: "sun"
Required overlay size: 120x60 pixels
Placement instruction: in the sky above her
Interaction style: anchored_to_background

The coordinate system:
- Origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner
- X increases rightward (0 to 255)
- Y increases downward (0 to 113)

Based on the placement instruction and the visual content of the frame, determine the exact pixel bounds for the overlay.

Return ONLY a JSON object with the pixel coordinates:
{
  "top_left": {
    "x": <x_coordinate>,
    "y": <y_coordinate>
  },
  "bottom_right": {
    "x": <x_coordinate>,
    "y": <y_coordinate>
  }
}

The bounding box should:
1. Be exactly 120 pixels wide and 60 pixels tall
2. Follow the placement instruction "in the sky above her"
3. Not exceed frame boundaries (0 to 255 for x, 0 to 113 for y)
4. Be positioned for optimal visual balance and readability

Example valid response for a 100x50 overlay in top-left corner:
{
  "top_left": {
    "x": 20,
    "y": 20
  },
  "bottom_right": {
    "x": 119,
    "y": 69
  }
}

Important: bottom_right.x = top_left.x + 119, bottom_right.y = top_left.y + 59
