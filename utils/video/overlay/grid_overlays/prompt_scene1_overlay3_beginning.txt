Given a video frame with a numbered grid overlay, determine the best grid cell number for placing the text "beginning".

Placement instruction: following the first line of text
Interaction style: anchored_to_background

Analyze the frame and return ONLY the grid cell number (e.g., "42") where this text should be placed.
Consider:
- The placement description provided
- Visual balance and composition
- Avoiding occlusion of important subjects
- The interaction style (whether it should move with characters or stay anchored)

Return only the cell number, nothing else.
