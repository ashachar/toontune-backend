Given a video frame with a numbered grid overlay, determine the best grid cells for placing the text overlay.

The overlay may span multiple grid cells. Provide the top-left and bottom-right corner cells.

Grid coordinates are in format (row, column) where:
- Row 1 is at the top, increasing downward
- Column 1 is at the left, increasing rightward
- Example: (3,5) means 3rd row from top, 5th column from left

Placement instruction: top left corner
Text to place: "Let's"
Interaction style: anchored_to_background
Element size: 100x50 pixels
Grid size: 10x9 cells

Analyze the frame and determine:
1. Top-left corner cell for the overlay
2. Bottom-right corner cell for the overlay

If the overlay fits within a single cell, both corners should be the same cell.
If the overlay needs more space, specify different cells to create a bounding rectangle.

Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "top_left": "row,column",
  "bottom_right": "row,column"
}

Example responses:
- Single cell: {"top_left": "2,3", "bottom_right": "2,3"}
- Multiple cells: {"top_left": "2,3", "bottom_right": "4,5"}
- Wide text: {"top_left": "5,2", "bottom_right": "5,8"}

Consider:
- The placement description provided
- Visual balance and composition
- Text/element size relative to grid cells
- Avoiding occlusion of important subjects
- The interaction style (whether it should move with characters or stay anchored)
