Given a video frame with a numbered grid overlay, determine the best grid cells for placing the text overlay.

The overlay may span multiple grid cells. Provide the top-left and bottom-right corner cells.

Grid coordinates are in format (row, column) where:
- Row 1 is at the top, increasing downward
- Column 1 is at the left, increasing rightward
- Example: (3,5) means 3rd row from top, 5th column from left

Placement instruction: in the sky above her
Text to place: "sun"
Interaction style: anchored_to_background
Element size: 120x60 pixels
Grid size: 9x8 cells
Cell size: approximately 32x12 pixels each

Analyze the frame and determine:
1. Top-left corner cell for the overlay
2. Bottom-right corner cell for the overlay

Return ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "top_left": "row,column",
  "bottom_right": "row,column"
}
