You are analyzing a video frame to determine where to place a text overlay.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The text overlay must be placed on BACKGROUND areas, NOT on top of people, faces, or main subjects in the frame. Prioritize empty sky, grass, walls, or other background elements.

Frame dimensions: 256x114 pixels
Text overlay: "sun"
Required overlay size: 120x60 pixels
Placement instruction: in the sky above her
Interaction style: anchored_to_background

The coordinate system:
- Origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner
- X increases rightward (0 to 255)
- Y increases downward (0 to 113)

PLACEMENT RULES (in order of priority):
1. NEVER place text over faces, heads, or bodies of people/characters
2. NEVER place text over important objects being held or interacted with
3. PREFER placement over:
   - Sky areas
   - Plain backgrounds
   - Grass or ground (if no subjects are there)
   - Empty wall spaces
   - Dark or uniform areas
4. MAINTAIN readability - avoid busy patterns or high-contrast edges
5. FOLLOW the placement instruction while respecting rules 1-4

For the placement "in the sky above her":
- First identify where subjects/characters are located
- Then find the nearest suitable background area
- Adjust position to avoid any overlap with subjects

Return ONLY a JSON object with the pixel coordinates:
{
  "top_left": {
    "x": <x_coordinate>,
    "y": <y_coordinate>
  },
  "bottom_right": {
    "x": <x_coordinate>,
    "y": <y_coordinate>
  },
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation of why this position avoids subjects>"
}

The bounding box must:
- Be exactly 120 pixels wide and 60 pixels tall
- Not exceed frame boundaries (0 to 255 for x, 0 to 113 for y)
- Avoid ALL subjects and main objects in the scene

Example for "sun" with instruction "in the sky above her":
If there's a person in the center-bottom of frame, and instruction is "in the sky above her":
{
  "top_left": {
    "x": 20,
    "y": 5
  },
  "bottom_right": {
    "x": 139,
    "y": 64
  },
  "reasoning": "Placed in upper sky area, well above the person's head to avoid any overlap"
}

Remember: bottom_right.x = top_left.x + 119, bottom_right.y = top_left.y + 59
