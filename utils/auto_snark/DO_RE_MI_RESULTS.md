### Snark Timeline

| Time | Original Dialogue | Cynical Commentary |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 3.8s | (Opening silence) | "Oh good, another musical number. How original." |
| 16.8s | "When you read, you begin with ABC" | "Yes, because ABC is such complex knowledge." |
| 25.5s | "Do, Re, Mi" (repeated) | "We get it. You can repeat three syllables." |
| 41.8s | "Let's see if I can make it easier" | "Easier? This is your idea of pedagogy?" |
| 48.0s | "Do, a deer, a female deer" | "Revolutionary. A deer is... a deer." |
| 52.5s | "Mi, a name I call myself" | "Mi, the narcissism is showing." |
