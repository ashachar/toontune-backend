## Next Steps

The prompts are ready for inference. To process them:

```bash
# Run inference with the new V2 prompts
python unified_video_pipeline_refactored.py \
  uploads/assets/videos/do_re_mi/video.mp4 \
  --no-downsample \
  --no-transcript \
  --no-scenes \
  --no-prompts
```

This will generate editing instructions that include cartoon characters and key phrases instead of word-by-word overlays.
