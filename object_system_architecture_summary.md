# Object-Based Animation Architecture - Summary

## Problem Statement
The original animation system had a critical flaw where objects with `is_behind=True` would cache their occlusion masks during animation, leading to stale mask positions when the foreground moved. This was most visible with the 'r' in 'World' around frame 45-50 (1.5-2.0s) where pixels would "stick" to outdated foreground positions.

## Root Cause
The animation logic and post-processing (occlusion) were tightly coupled. Once an animation started (e.g., dissolve), the mask was calculated once and reused, even as the foreground moved.

## Architectural Solution

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Created a new object-based architecture that separates:
- **Object State**: Persistent properties (position, scale, is_behind, etc.)
- **Animation Logic**: Temporary transformations (motion, dissolve effects)
- **Post-Processing**: Frame-by-frame effects based on object state

### 2. Core Components

#### SceneObject (`scene_object.py`)
- Base class for all renderable objects
- Maintains persistent state via `ObjectState` dataclass
- Key innovation: `requires_mask_update()` method that ALWAYS returns `True` for `is_behind=True` objects
- State changes trigger appropriate update flags

#### RenderPipeline (`render_pipeline.py`)
- Orchestrates rendering of all scene objects
- Applies animations as transformations
- CRITICAL: Applies post-processing based on object STATE, not animation state
- Ensures proper z-ordering and compositing

#### PostProcessor System (`post_processor.py`)
- Abstract base class for all post-processing effects
- `OcclusionProcessor`: ALWAYS extracts fresh masks for `is_behind=True` objects
- Key fix: No mask caching for objects behind foreground - recalculated EVERY frame

#### Animation Adapters (`animation_adapter.py`)
- Translate existing animations to work with object system
- `MotionAnimationAdapter`: Updates position/scale during motion phase
- `DissolveAnimationAdapter`: Updates opacity/scale during dissolve phase
- Animations only update object state, never handle occlusion directly

### 3. Key Design Decisions

1. **Forced Fresh Masks**: Objects with `is_behind=True` MUST recalculate masks every frame, regardless of animation state
2. **State Persistence**: Object state persists across animations, ensuring consistency
3. **Post-Processing Independence**: Post-processors check object state, not animation phase
4. **Clear Separation**: Animations transform objects; post-processors apply visual effects

## Implementation Details

### Object Lifecycle
```python
# 1. Create object with initial state
letter = LetterObject(char='r', position=(100, 200))
letter.set_behind(True)  # Marks for occlusion processing

# 2. Add to pipeline
pipeline.add_object(letter)

# 3. Each frame:
animations = animation_adapter.apply(objects, frame_num)
composite = pipeline.render_frame(background, frame_num, animations)
# - Applies animation transforms to update object state
# - Renders object based on current state
# - ALWAYS applies fresh occlusion if is_behind=True
```

### Critical Fix in OcclusionProcessor
```python
def process(self, object_sprite, object_state, frame_number, background, **kwargs):
    # CRITICAL: Extract fresh mask EVERY TIME for is_behind objects
    mask = self.extract_foreground_mask(background, frame_number)
    # Never cache, always fresh extraction
```

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Correctness**: Occlusion masks are always current, fixing the stale mask bug
2. **Modularity**: Clear separation between animations and effects
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new animations or post-processors
4. **Performance**: Only recalculates what's necessary based on object state
5. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility

### Core System
- `utils/animations/object_system/__init__.py` - Module initialization
- `utils/animations/object_system/scene_object.py` - Object and state classes
- `utils/animations/object_system/post_processor.py` - Post-processing system
- `utils/animations/object_system/render_pipeline.py` - Rendering orchestration

## Migration Path

To migrate existing animations:
1. Create `LetterObject` instances instead of raw sprites
2. Use animation adapters instead of direct frame manipulation
3. Let the pipeline handle compositing and post-processing
4. Remove any manual occlusion handling from animations

## Conclusion

The object-based architecture successfully fixes the stale mask bug by ensuring that occlusion is a property of object state, not animation state. This fundamental redesign makes the system more robust, maintainable, and extensible while solving the critical issue where masks would become stale during animation.
